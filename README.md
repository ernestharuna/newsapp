Open VS Code or IDE of choice (of course), open terminal
Run the following - 
- git clone **https://github.com/ernestharuna/newsapp**
- cd <project-directory>
- npm install

 **If error is thrown on start run these commands to install required dependenc**
- npm install dayjs
- npm install axios
- npm install react-router-dom
- npm install sass

 And finally :)
