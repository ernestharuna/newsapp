# How to Run
Open VS Code or IDE of choice (of course), open terminal
Run the following - 
- git clone **https://github.com/ernestharuna/newsapp**
- cd project-directory
- npm install
- npm run dev
  
 **If error is thrown on start, run these commands to install required dependencies**
- npm install dayjs
- npm install axios
- npm install react-router-dom
- npm install sass
- npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
- npm install react-redux

And finally :)
 **If you get a 429 error or page doesn't load.**
- Replace API KEYS with yours in src/views/Home.jsx; line 25.
 
  
## NB: This isn't build with CRA command, so 'npm start' will not work. Make sure to use NPM RUN DEV.
  
**_Happy coding and vetting :)_**
